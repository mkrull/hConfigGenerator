hConfigGenerator
================

generate files from stringtemplates and json variables in haskell

## TODO cabal file

## Compile

Until a cabal file is added run

> ghc configGenerator

with will of course fail if the dependencies are missing.. which are some. To list them here is pointless as I could just create a cabal file with much the same effort.

## Run

./configGenerator templates/test.st templates/test.json
